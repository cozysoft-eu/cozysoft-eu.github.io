My name is Jean and I am a passionate software developer. I've been developing software for about 14 years now, originally only for my own purposes, nowadays also on behalf of customers.

I'm an OpenSource enthusiast and I specialize in backend development, although I can also develop frontend. I use programming languages like Rust, Python, C# or JavaScript to turn my ideas into reality. In frontend development I mainly use Svelte (JavaScript), Avalonia (C#) or WPF (C#).
I also speak fluent English (level C1).

In my main job as an IT developer, I develop in-house software solutions, which mainly connect our ERP software BÃ¼roWARE to various systems.

In June 2022 I founded Softwareschmiede, where I develop and offer software solutions in my spare time.
