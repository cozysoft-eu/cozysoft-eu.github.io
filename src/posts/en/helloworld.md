Hello World!

My name is Jean-Luc Nürrenberg (also called cozyGalvinism or **cozy** for short) and I'm a software developer from Germany!
I have been developing software for private and commercial purposes for about 14 years, both in the open source and closed source environment, and I specialize mainly in interface software and backend development.
My skills include multiple programming languages like Rust, Python and C#, SQL databases like MySQL, PostgreSQL and SQLite as well as NoSQL databases like MongoDB or LiteDB.

I work full-time as an IT developer at Bon Mercato GmbH and will manage the Softwareschmiede in my spare time.

Enough about me :)

Welcome to cozy's Softwareschmiede!
Here you will find information about my ongoing and completed projects, as well as informative articles about new technologies, which I will try to incorporate into future projects.

At the time of the release of this article, I am not yet accepting any projects due to my main job being busy, but this will change in the future. Please be patient until then.

I wish you a pleasant rest of June and a good start into July!
